GPS Generator
-------------

This application generates 4 points for each one of the landmarks selected.
Landmarks are randomly selected from the 'separate' sheet in the supplied
xls file. 

The supplied file can be replaced either by another xls file or by a tab-
separated file, provided the columns are named as in the separate sheet
in the supplied file.

Note: only xls files are supported (i.e., not xlsx)

To test the application on Windows:

	test.bat

To test the application on *nix:

	test.sh
